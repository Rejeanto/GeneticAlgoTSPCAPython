# Traveling Salesman Problem - Solved using Gentic Algoritm.
A solution to brute force approach to compute Traveling Salesman problem using Genetic Algorithm that gives best possible results with much lesser time complexity. 
This code computes the shortest distance from a start city to endCity/startCity via other cities. 
The input given are the 27 cities from california and the distances to other cities.
